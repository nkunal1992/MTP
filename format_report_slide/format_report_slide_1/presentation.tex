\section{Introduction} \label{Introduction}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Digital video has become a popular storage and exchange medium due to the rapid development in recording technology, improved video compression techniques and high-speed networks in the last few years. 
	
	\item As a result, there has been a huge increase in the amount of multimedia data on the Web. Therefore, for a user it is nearly impossible to find desired videos without a search function  within a video archive.
	
	\item The requested information may be covered in only a few minutes, the user might thus want to find the piece of information he requires without viewing the complete video.

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Objective} \label{Objective}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Objective}
\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Most of the video retrieval and video search systems such as YouTube, Bing and Vimeo rely on available textual metadata such as title, genre, person, and brief description, etc. 
	\item Generally, this kind of metadata has to be created by a human to ensure a high quality, but the creation step is rather time and cost consuming.
	\item Our target is to generate metadata automatically using video analysis tool.
	
\end{itemize}

\section{Terminology} \label{Terminology}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Terminology}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Mean Square Error(MSE) : MSE is the cumulative squared error between the two frame F1 and F2.
		\begin{center}
			$MSE(F1,F2) = \frac{1}{MN}\sum_{n=1}^{M}\sum_{m=1}^{N}[F2(n,m)-F1(n,m)]^2$
		\end{center}
		\item Manhattan Distance : The manhattan distance is the simple sum of the
		horizontal and vertical components.
		\begin{center}
			$MH(a,b) = |x_1-y_1|+|x_2-y_2|+...+|x_n-y_n|$
			\\where $a = (x_1,x_2,x_3,...,x_n) , b=(y_1,y_2,y_3,...,y_n)$
		\end{center}
		\item Euclidean Distance : It is the straight-line distance between two pixels.  the euclidean distance
		between two points $a = (a_x, a_y)$ and $b = (b_x, b_y)$ is defined as :
		\begin{center}
			$d(a,b) = \sqrt{(b_x-a_x)^2+(b_y-a_y)^2}$
		\end{center}

\section{Conclusion}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Conclusion }

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Course presentation should be consistent. Latex based would be preferrable.
		\item Manual fine tuning of threshold is required.
		\item Region for Topic/Subtopic is dependent on slide format.
		\item Need to run on different lecture to see the effectiveness of the method.
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\section{Future Work}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Future Work }
\begin{itemize}
	\item We will analyse on different course where presentation is consistent.
	\item Topic/Subtopic selection based on text extraction(OCR) of Topic/Subtopic area. 
	\item Exploration of DNN based approach.
